Job Monitoring and Skill-Based Clustering System
This project automatically scrapes job postings from karkidi.com, clusters them based on required skills using unsupervised machine learning, and notifies users when new jobs match their skill interests.

🚀 Features
🔍 Scrapes latest job postings (title, company, location, required skills)

🤖 Clusters jobs using K-Means on TF-IDF vectors of required skills

🧠 Trained model saved and reused for classifying new postings

📌 Users can select skill-based clusters to receive job alerts

📅 Supports automated daily scraping (via scheduler or cron)

📊 Streamlit dashboard for interactive job exploration

📁 Data Collected
Each job entry includes:

Job Title

Company Name

Required Skills

Location (if available)

🧪 Clustering Workflow
Preprocessing: Clean skills text, tokenize, and vectorize using TF-IDF

Clustering: Group jobs using K-Means

Evaluation: Assessed via silhouette score and manual inspection

Matching: User preferences are matched to clusters for alerts
